Basic TCP and UDP servers


These are very simple TCP and UDP servers and clients. They can be tested by using a Mininet VM in order to run multiple hosts and by binding the client and server to the same listening port.


Mininet VM information can be found at the link below:

A TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) server uses a secure 3-way handshake connection to pass acknowledgements and data to the client, this is considered a reliable data transfer protocol. A UDP (User Datagram Protocol) server is connectionless and does not bind itself to a particular client.


Running the servers and clients will show the difference between TCP and UDP servers and data transfer.
